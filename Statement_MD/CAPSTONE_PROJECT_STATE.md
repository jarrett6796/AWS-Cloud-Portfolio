# Project State

## Current Identity

This project is a cloud engineering portfolio and serverless RAG assistant platform.

The original target was an AWS Cloud Resume + Lambda/Bedrock RAG architecture. Because the Lambda/Bedrock RAG path was not practical to complete at the current stage, the AI/RAG backend was intentionally pivoted to Google Cloud Platform.

Current working direction:

```text
React + Vite Portfolio
  -> AWS serverless visitor counter
  -> GCP Cloud Run RAG backend
  -> Gemini + Firestore + GCS retrieval
```

This means the project currently demonstrates both:

- AWS serverless fundamentals through the deployed visitor counter path.
- GCP AI/RAG engineering through the working Cloud Run + Gemini + Firestore retrieval backend.

## Current Stack

### Frontend

- React + Vite
- JavaScript
- Plain CSS
- Modular component/hook/API structure
- Dark/light mode
- Bilingual UI: English and Traditional Chinese
- Floating homepage AI assistant
- Project modal workspace
- Live visitor counter

### AWS Visitor Counter

- S3 static hosting
- CloudFront CDN + HTTPS
- API Gateway
- Lambda
- DynamoDB

### GCP RAG Backend

- FastAPI
- Cloud Run
- Vertex AI Gemini API
- Gemini 2.5 Flash
- text-embedding-005
- Firestore document chunks and embeddings
- Google Cloud Storage document source files

## Current Architecture

## Current Frontend Structure

├── pages/
│   └── Home.jsx
├── App.jsx
├── App.css
├── index.css
└── main.jsx
```

`App.jsx` is now intentionally thin and delegates page composition to `pages/Home.jsx`.

## Repository Layout Decision

The capstone should be tracked as one outer Git repository.

- `frontend-Vite/` is part of the main capstone repository.
- `frontend-Vite/` should not contain its own `.git` directory.
- V1 should be recorded with a Git commit/tag plus `Statement_MD/CAPSTONE_V1_TEST_RECORD.md`, not by copying the full project folder.
- Local generated files such as `.DS_Store`, `node_modules/`, `dist/`, and `.env` are ignored by the root `.gitignore`.

## Current Backend Structure

```text
backend-GCP/
├── app/
│   ├── config/
│   │   └── settings.py
│   ├── schemas/
│   │   └── chat_schema.py
│   ├── routes/
│   │   ├── chat.py
│   │   ├── health.py
│   │   └── rag.py
│   └── services/
│       ├── firestore_service.py
│       ├── gcs_service.py
│       ├── gemini_service.py

│       ├── rag_service.py
│       └── vector_service.py
├── Dockerfile
├── main.py
└── requirements.txt
```

The backend works, but it is still MVP-shaped. The main backend refactor is now mostly complete: config, schemas, services, and route modules have been extracted while preserving `main:app` for Cloud Run.

## Working Features

- Frontend production build works.
- Frontend lint passes.
- Portfolio UI is modularized.
- Homepage AI assistant calls `/ask-rag` through `src/api/chat.js`.
- Visitor counter logic is isolated in `src/api/visitors.js`.
- Theme behavior is isolated in `useTheme.js`.
- Scroll progress and active section tracking are isolated in `useScrollTracker.js`.
- GCP backend supports `/ask-rag` retrieval and Gemini generation.
- GCP backend supports `/ingest-docs` document chunking and embedding storage.
- Backend config now lives in `backend-GCP/app/config/settings.py`.
- Backend request and response schemas now live in `backend-GCP/app/schemas/chat_schema.py`.
- Gemini generation and embedding calls now live in `backend-GCP/app/services/gemini_service.py`.
- GCS access now lives in `backend-GCP/app/services/gcs_service.py`.
- Firestore access now lives in `backend-GCP/app/services/firestore_service.py`.
- Chunking, cosine similarity, and top-k selection now live in `backend-GCP/app/services/vector_service.py`.
- RAG orchestration now lives in `backend-GCP/app/services/rag_service.py`.
- Document ingestion now lives in `backend-GCP/app/services/ingestion_service.py`.
- Endpoint handlers now live in `backend-GCP/app/routes/`.

## Known Limitations

- Retrieval now uses vector scoring, optional hybrid keyword scoring, optional reranking, a configurable candidate pool, and a score threshold, but still scans Firestore in memory.
- Chunking now respects Markdown headings and paragraph boundaries before falling back to size splitting.
- No streaming responses yet.
- No chat history yet.
- Grounded answer prompt now requires source ID citations for factual claims.
- Ingestion now uses deterministic Firestore chunk IDs and prunes stale duplicate chunk documents.
- Contact form is UI-only.
- Original AWS Lambda/Bedrock RAG path is deferred, not the current implementation.

## Near-Term Next Steps

### Frontend Next Steps

- Keep current modular frontend stable.
- Avoid visual redesign unless it improves clarity.
- Optionally remove unused starter assets later.
- Keep build/lint verification after each frontend change.

### Backend

Refactor in this order:

Completed:

1. `app/config/settings.py`
2. `app/schemas/chat_schema.py`
3. `app/services/gemini_service.py`
4. `app/services/gcs_service.py`
5. `app/services/firestore_service.py`
6. `app/services/vector_service.py`
7. `app/services/rag_service.py`
8. `app/services/ingestion_service.py`
9. `app/routes/health.py`, `chat.py`, `rag.py`
10. Response schemas in `app/schemas/chat_schema.py`
11. Config cleanup for CORS, document lists, chunk size, and top-k defaults

Next:

1. Add chat history.
2. Add streaming responses.
3. Add monitoring and production hardening.

### Advanced RAG Roadmap

Planned order:

1. Controlled error handling.
2. Structured logging.
3. Idempotent ingestion.
4. Better markdown-aware chunking.
5. Chunk metadata and content hashing.
6. Improved retrieval with score thresholds and a larger candidate pool.
7. Optional hybrid keyword + vector retrieval.
8. Optional reranking.
9. Grounded answer prompt with citations.
10. Chat history.
11. Streaming responses.
12. Monitoring and production hardening.

Current backend phase:

```text
Phase 10 — Chat history
```

Completed advanced RAG phases:

1. Controlled error handling.
2. Structured logging.
3. Idempotent ingestion.
4. Better markdown-aware chunking.
5. Chunk metadata and content hashing.
6. Improved retrieval with score thresholds and larger candidate pool.
7. Optional hybrid keyword + vector retrieval.
8. Optional reranking.
9. Grounded answer prompt with citations.

Phase 1 added controlled backend exceptions and stable JSON error payloads while preserving endpoint paths and `main:app`.

Phase 2 added JSON-formatted Cloud Run logs, request IDs, request duration logs, controlled error logs, and metadata-only service logs for Gemini, GCS, Firestore, ingestion, and RAG flow.

Phase 3 made `/ingest-docs` rerunnable by using deterministic Firestore chunk document IDs and pruning stale duplicate chunk documents after successful file ingestion.

Phase 4 replaced fixed-size-only chunking with Markdown-aware chunking that keeps headings with section content and falls back to paragraph or size splitting for oversized sections.

Phase 5 added chunk metadata and content hashes, including Firestore fields for `content_hash`, `char_count`, and `heading`, plus optional `/ask-rag` source metadata fields.

Phase 6 added configurable retrieval selection with `RAG_CANDIDATE_POOL_SIZE` and `RAG_SCORE_THRESHOLD`, so weak chunks are filtered before the final `RAG_TOP_K` prompt context is built.

Phase 7 added opt-in hybrid keyword + vector retrieval with `RAG_HYBRID_ENABLED` and `RAG_VECTOR_SCORE_WEIGHT`. Hybrid retrieval is disabled by default to preserve current Cloud Run behavior.

Phase 8 added opt-in deterministic reranking with `RAG_RERANK_ENABLED` and `RAG_RERANK_KEYWORD_WEIGHT`. Reranking is disabled by default to preserve current Cloud Run behavior.

Phase 9 added stable source IDs, source metadata, and stricter prompt instructions requiring citation labels such as `[S1]` for factual claims.

## Latest RAG Deployment Test

Completed on 2026-06-04:

- Deployed latest backend to Cloud Run revision:
  - `gcp-rag-backend-00009-m6h`
- Current RAG source file in GCS:
  - `CAPSTONE_PROJECT_STATE.md`
- Cloud Run ingestion environment now uses:
  - `INGEST_DOCUMENTS=CAPSTONE_PROJECT_STATE.md`
  - `DIRECT_CONTEXT_DOCUMENTS=CAPSTONE_PROJECT_STATE.md`
- Cleared stale Firestore chunks from:
  - `document_chunks`
- Rebuilt RAG index through:
  - `POST /ingest-docs`
- Ingestion result:
  - `chunks_created: 24`
  - `chunks_pruned: 0`
- Verified `/ask-rag` now returns citation labels like `[S1]` and source metadata from `CAPSTONE_PROJECT_STATE.md`.

Target pattern:

```text
request -> route -> service -> provider/client
```

Avoid keeping the long-term backend pattern as:

```text
request -> main.py -> everything
```

This long-term anti-pattern has been addressed structurally. `main.py` now stays as the Cloud Run entrypoint and app composition file.

## Verification Commands

Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend-Vite
npm run lint
npm run build
```

Backend compile check:

```bash
cd backend-GCP
python -m py_compile main.py
```
